 *   Commercial deployment requires a separate written license agreement.
 *   Unauthorized sharing, distribution, or public demonstration of this

 *   don't. The paperwork alone would ruin your week.
 *
 *
 *   § 2. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 *
 *   This software is the intellectual property of the Government of

 *
 *   § 4. TERMINATION
 *
 *   This License remains in effect until terminated by either party.
 *   You may terminate at any time by destroying the software and all

 *
 *   The Applications Development Section has made every reasonable
 *   effort to ensure reliability, but software, much like government
 *   policy, may occasionally behave in unexpected ways. Use is at
 *   your own risk. Some jurisdictions may afford additional statutory
 *   rights.
 *
 *
 *   § 6. SEVERABILITY
 *
 *   If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
 *   unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining
 *   provisions shall continue in full force and effect. One clause
 *   may fall. The rest stand. Much like county infrastructure
 *   during the long rains.
 *
 *
 *   § 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
 *
 *   IN NO EVENT SHALL MARTIN MBITHI, THE GOVERNMENT OF MAKUENI
 *   COUNTY, THE APPLICATIONS DEVELOPMENT SECTION, OR THEIR

 *   INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY
 *   DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THIS
 *   SOFTWARE.
 *
 *   Total liability shall not exceed the license fee paid, if any.
 *   If the amount is zero, we trust you see where the math lands.
 *   No drama. Just governance, code, and service delivery.
