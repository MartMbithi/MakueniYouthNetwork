 *
 *
 *   § 6. SEVERABILITY
 *
 *   If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or

 *   may fall. The rest stand. Much like county infrastructure
 *   during the long rains.
 *
 *
 *   § 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
 *
 *   IN NO EVENT SHALL MARTIN MBITHI, THE GOVERNMENT OF MAKUENI
 *   COUNTY, THE APPLICATIONS DEVELOPMENT SECTION, OR THEIR

 *   DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THIS
 *   SOFTWARE.
 *
 *   Total liability shall not exceed the license fee paid, if any.
 *   If the amount is zero, we trust you see where the math lands.
 *   No drama. Just governance, code, and service delivery.
